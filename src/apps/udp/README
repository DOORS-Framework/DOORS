With udp_demo, you can send UDP datagrams to another host and port. 
You can send a file or allow the program to generate random data. 

The same program acts as a sender and a receiver. If destination host
is given, send mode is assumed. Otherwise, the program is put to
receive mode. 

In send mode, a user can choose how many times a file or random data
frame is sent with flag '-l'. If zero times is given, it is interpreted
as infinite loop and the user can stop sending with Ctrl-C. If input
filename is given with flag '-i', that file is sent instead of random
data. Looping policy is different for file. With command

	udp_demo -ifoo -l5 ...

file 'foo' is sent five (5) times as a whole whatever the frame size is.
However, command

	udp_demo -l5 -f1000 ...

(without input file) sends five (5) 1000 byte long frames with random
data.

In receiving mode, that is when output file name is given, the program
waits for the data coming from predefined port. It is then saved to 
output file. File "-" is standard out, i.e. giving parameter '-o-' 
makes udp_demo to print all the received data to the screen. The data
is printed without any filtering, so it is not recommended if the
sender throws some binary data (like random data generator does) to
the receiver.

Here are the flags that are recognized by udp_demo:

	-m <type>	Memory manager type. The default is plain.
	-f <size>	Frame size. The default is 5000 (bytes).
	-p <port>	Receiving port. The default is 50000.
	-q <port>	Destination port. The default is 50001.
	-o <file>	Filename where to save the received UDP packets.
	-i <file>	File to be sent as UDP datagrams.
	-l <loops>	Number of loops. Zero means infinite. The default
			is to send once.
	-h <host>	Destination host. Hostname or IP-address.
